We have teamed up with Systime to bring you this out-of-the-ordinary meetup.

Throughout the past few months, Systime has upgraded their entire platform to be PSR-2 & PSR-4 compliant, and will be giving a talk on this.
Softdrinks and beer will be provided by Systime at your leisure.

Schedule for the meetup
- 16:00-16:10: Arrival. Welcome.

- 16:15-16:30: Briefly about Systime and the digital transformation / Kasper Ligaard, CTO

- 16:45-17:30: Testing TYPO3 using Codeception and SauceLabs / Mads LÃ¸nne Jensen, Senior Developer

- 17:30-20:00: Mingling and networking.

Ask us about PSR-2, PSR-4 and PHP 7, as well as TYPO3 7 LTS, Composer, Jenkins CI - or anything else you feel like.
